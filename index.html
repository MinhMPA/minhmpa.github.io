<p> Hello and Xin chào! I am a cosmologist interested in tracking the growth of large-scale structure (LSS) of the cosmos, over the entire Universe history. I model and combine different probes of LSS: from <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1106522/hl202412">counting galaxies</a>, to <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/1052846/hl202204?c=27981">measuring galaxy alignment </a>and <a href="https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/926077/hl202103">weighing galaxy clusters</a>. </p>

<p> My cosmic investigation has led me to the first 4-sigma evidence for a late-time suppression in the rate at which LSS has been growing, highlighted on <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.111001">Phys. Rev. Lett.</a> and featured on <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-possible-crisis-in-the-cosmos-could-lead-to-a-new-understanding-of-the-universe/">Scientific American</a> as well as <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2391414-the-universes-evolution-seems-to-be-slowing-and-we-dont-know-why/">New Scientist</a>. I have also developed a novel framework to maximally extract cosmological information from galaxy surveys---now known as field-level (Bayesian) inference---a work that became my second <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.221006">Phys. Rev. Lett.</a> and got me the <a href="https://www.buchaltercosmologyprize.org/">Buchalter Cosmology Prize</a> in 2024. </p>

<p> I am currently a Kavli IPMU Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Physics and Mathematics of the Universe, University of Tokyo. Before joining IPMU, I was a Leinwber Fellow at the Leinweber Center for Theoretical Physics, University of Michigan. Even before that, I obtained my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. </p>

<p>Summary of my research and education can be found in my <a href="https://minhmpa.github.io/academic-cv/">CV</a>. Also see other tabs on this page for more info. </p>
